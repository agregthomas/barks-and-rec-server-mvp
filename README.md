Planning
------

#### BRAINSTORM ####
I knew from the start of the course I wanted to write an application having something to do with dogs. Joking with a few classmates, we cooked up an idea for a site that would allow you to register your pup and be matched with other dog-lovers looking for a play date! Thus, Barks and Rec was born.

#### GOALS ####
1. Create a resource for CRUDing Dog Profiles.
- Integrate with a third-party datastore to allow for storage of dog avatars.
2. Create a resource for traking local meet-up spots (i.e. Parks, dog-friendly venues, etc.).
- Integrate with a third-party API capable of parsing geolocation data.
- Categorize by neighborhood.


Process
------
* Refactoring the Express Template to sit on a PostgreSQL database instead of MongoDB.
  - Explored using an ORM (Knex.js being the most popular). Ultimately used SQL queries with Node's pg package.
  - Introduced pg-patch middleware for dynamically constructing PATCH requests.
* Refactoring Auth on the front-end to conform to the new data standard.
* Research and implement Google Maps API.


Problem-Solving Strategy
------

* Utilized online resources such as StackOverflow to investigate ways to resolve issues
* Extensive research on best-practices for implementing SQL with Node, including connection pooling, Promisified queries, and building programmatic queries.
* Utilized a Chrome React Extension allowing state to be traceable through the console.
* Submitted inquiries to the General Assembly Project Issue queue to request assistance from instructors

Back-to-Life, Back-to-Reactality
----
If the above sounds ambitious for a four-day project, you are far more perceptive than I dear reader. The best laid plans of mice and men as they say...

Of the above-mentioned features, only the ability to CRUD on dogs has been implemented.

Plans for Future Improvements
------
* Finish refactoring the template to sit on top of a PSQL database. Tasks remaining:
  - Finish boilerplate Auth.
  - Implement pg-patch library to allow for dynamic construction of UPDATE queries.
  - Research Knex.js and possibly refactor with ORM best practices for a more "modern" feel.
* Create resources for persisting Dog-friendly Locations and for users to schedule Play Dates.
  - Possibility for gamifying users' participation (e.g. if your dog has been on 5+ play dates it gets a "Good Boy Award").
  - Enhance Location resource with geoloc data and render it with Google Maps API.
- Update Dog resource with image upload to allow for creation of Avatars.
- More fun with Material-UI!
